# notes-task-lendis


Please create a small notepad application for NodeJS with Typescript. that contains those REST endpoints:

 * Create a note
 * List notes
 * Update a note
 * Delete a note
 * Delete multiple notes at the same time

 Requirements:
 * Notes contain of a title, the actual message, and some tags. Title and message need to be set. Tags is just words - Nothing fancy
 * Include a validation of the notes
 * Data should be stored in a sql- or nosql database - What you prefer. Use an ORM if you like.
 * Add some sample tests (e. g. with jest) - Not everything must be tested, just to get an impression

I recommend you to use expressJS. Keep it rather simple than fancy ;-)

It would be great if you can do that until the beginning of the next week If you have any further questions let me know.
